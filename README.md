# Target-Bulls-Eye-Wish
Target Bulls "Eye" Wish is a website application that allows customers to alert Target of desired commodities. It is a platform that provides Target insight into regional demand for specific goods. My team and I won an award for this application.

More detailed description:
Our idea was to create a web application with a contact form that customers can fill out when a product they desire is unavailable at their local Target. Using Target's API in conjunction with the provided zip code, the application will either let them know that a nearby Target carries the product or the application will update a database to reflect the need for the item in that location. Once the product becomes available, Target will use the contact information provided to inform the customer.
