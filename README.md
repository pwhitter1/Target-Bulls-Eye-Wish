# Target-Bulls-Eye-Wish
Target Bulls "Eye" Wish is a website application that allows customers to alert Target of desired commodities. It is a platform that provides Target insight into regional demand for specific goods. My team and I won an award for this application.

More detailed description:
If you desire a product that your local Target does not carry, you can fill out our simple contact form. Using Target's API in conjunction with your provided zip code, the application will either tell you that a nearby store carries the product or the application will update a database to reflect the need for the product in that location. Once the product becomes available, Target will use the contact information provided to inform the customer.
